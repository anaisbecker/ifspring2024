        <ol>
            <li>My name is Anais Becker, I am a computer science major, and I am a senior.</li>
            <li>I am an HCI minor so I chose to take this class to combine my interests in coding and design.</li>
            <li>I have some basic exposure to HTML/CSS, as I have made a handful of very simple websites.</li>
            <li>I hope to learn how to use CSS to create interestingly designed websites.</li>
            <li>I expect a lot of the functional design choices to be different on screen vs. on paper, such as typeface, sizing, colors, etc. due to user needs.</li>
