        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc):</b><br>
                My name is Anais Becker, I am a computer science major, and I am a senior.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class:</b><br>
                I am an HCI minor so I chose to take this class to combine my interests in coding and design.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it:</b><br>
                I have some basic exposure to HTML/CSS, as I have made a handful of very simple websites.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class:</b><br>
                I hope to learn how to use CSS to create interestingly designed websites.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper:</b><br>
                I expect a lot of the functional design choices to be different on screen vs. on paper, such as typeface, sizing, colors, etc. due to user needs.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice:</b><br>
                I think Youtube provides effective design, in that it is simple, clean, and is easy to navigate. The bar on the left provides easy access to necessary pages and channels, while the main page is dominated by popular videos. I find intuitive user navigation to be a hallmark of good design.</li>
            <a href="https://youtube.com/">Youtube</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li><b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice:</b><br>
                I think the WSJ is an example of effective communication. It provides all the necessary information about the articles without overwhelming the reader. Further, the organizational hierarchy is simple, with a top bar separating major categories and drop downs for specific topics. Finally, it displays stock market data cleanly so that a user can quickly deduce trends, which I think exemplifies effective communication.</li>
            <a href="https://www.wsj.com/">Wall Street Journal</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li><b>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice:</b><br>
                I think Github is a website that works well, because it allows for a seamless user experience for a relatively complex system (Git). The visualization of repositories, and within that, each individual git commit with the code changes is really intuitive to users, even if they have little experience with Git itself.</li>
