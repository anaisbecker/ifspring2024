        <h1>Shooting Star</h1>
        <h2>Bad Company</h2>
        <div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Johnny was a schoolboy<br>
                When he heard his first Beatles song<br>
                "Love Me Do", I think it was<br>
                And from there, it didn't take him long</p>

            <p>Got himself a guitar<br>
                Used to play every night<br>
                Now he's in a rock and roll outfit<br>
                And everything's all right<br>
                Don't ya know</p>

            <p>Johnny told his mama
                Hey, mama, I'm going away
                I'm gonna hit the big time
                Gonna be a big star someday</p>

            <p>Mama came to the door<br>
                With a teardrop in her eye<br>
                Johnny said, "don't cry, mama"<br>
                "Smile and wave goodbye"</p>

            <p>Don't you know (yeah, yeah)</p>

            <p>Don't you know<br>
                That you are a shooting star<br>
                Don't you know, don't you know<br>
                Don't you know that you are<br>
                A shooting star<br>
                And all the world will love you<br>
                Just as long, as long as you are</p>

            <p>Johnny made a record<br>
                Went straight up to number one<br>
                Suddenly everyone loved to hear him sing his song<br>
                Watching the world go by<br>
                Surprising it goes so fast<br>
                Johnny looked around him and said<br>
                "Well, I made the big time at last"<br>
                Don't you know<br>
                Don't you know</p>

            <p>Don't you know<br>
                That you are a shooting star<br>
                Don't you know, whoa, yeah<br>
                Don't you know that you are<br>
                A shooting star, yeah<br>
                And all the world will love you<br>
                Just as long, as long as you are</p>

            <p>A shooting star</p>

            <p>Don't you know<br>
                That you are a shooting star<br>
                Don't you know, ooh<br>
                Don't you know that you are<br>
                A shooting star<br>
                And all the world will love you<br>
                Just as long, as long as you are</p>

            <p>Johnny died one night<br>
                Died in his bed<br>
                Bottle of whiskey, sleeping tablets<br>
                By his head</p>

            <p>Johnny's life passed him by<br>
                Like a warm summer day<br>
                If you listen to the wind<br>
                You can still hear him play</p>

            <p>Ooh</p>

            <p>Don't you know that you are a shooting star<br>
                Don't you know, don't you know<br>
                Don't you know that you are a shooting star<br>
                Don't you know<br>
                Don't you know that you are a shooting star<br>
                Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you<br>
                Don't you know, don't you<br>
                Know, oh, that you are<br>
                A shooting star, yeah<br>
                Ooh, ooh, ooh, woo<br>
                Don't you, don't you know<br>
                That you are a shooting star<br>
                Don't you, don't you know</p>
